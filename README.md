**Breast Cancer Prediction Model using Support Vector Machine Algorithm**

**Overview**
This project implements a breast cancer prediction model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The model is trained on the widely used breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library, and aims to classify tumors as either malignant or benign.

**Repository Structure**
- `Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

**Features**
- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Splitting dataset into training and testing sets.
- Building and training the SVM model.
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report.

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**
